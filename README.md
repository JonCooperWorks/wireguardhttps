WireguardHTTPS
--------------
WireguardHTTPS is a Wireguard VPN controller.
It allows users to authenticate using Microsoft Azure AD and manage devices that belong to them.
The intention is to allow users to create arbitrary networks.
This program interfaces with [wgrpcd](https://github.com/JonCooperWorks/wgrpcd) and should not be run as root.
